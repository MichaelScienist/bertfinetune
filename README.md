Evaluating Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews: A Neural Network Approach
Authors: Mike Liu & Haoyu Wang
Abstract
This study critically examines the efficacy of the DistilBERT-base-uncased model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset. We investigated the model's performance in classifying sentiments across varying epochs to determine the optimal training duration. The intention was to shed light on the effects of training length on model precision and to offer insights into potential applications within natural language processing.
Introduction
In the digital era, where expressive and opinion-laden content is ubiquitously produced, the capability to sift through and understand vast amounts of text data is indispensable. Sentiment analysis stands at the forefront of this endeavor, offering key insights into public opinion and collective attitudes. The IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, with its balanced assembly of 50,000 reviews spanning the spectrum from acclaim to criticism, offers a robust platform for delving into sentiment dissection. It is this dataset that we chose to explore the intricate intricacies of sentiment analysis using machine learning models.
The focus of this study extends beyond mere sentiment classification; we aim to examine the fine-tuning aptitude of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model—specifically its DistilBERT-base-uncased variant. DistilBERT, with its streamlined architecture, promises to maintain the original BERT's efficacy while offering faster processing times and reduced model size. This makes it an excellent candidate for our investigation into training efficiency and effectiveness. A central question we address is the determination of the adequate amount of training data and the number of epochs required to achieve a proficient level of sentiment analysis.
Data 
It is true that our data set included a giant pile of reviews, half happy, half negative, each tagged with a score between 0 to 4, and the higher, the happier. The reason why we decided to go with IMBD is because it has a reasonable shape and feature. We shuffled the deck with 70% data for training and kept 30% in our back pocket for testing. The goal was to see how our model fared with fresh, unseen data.
Our investigation utilized the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, consisting of 50,000 reviews with an equal distribution of sentiments. Each review was scored on a scale from 0 (negative) to 4 (positive). We selected the DistilBERT-base-uncased model for its operational efficiency and proceeded to divide the dataset into a 70:30 split for training and validation purposes. The model underwent two distinct training intervals: a shorter 3-epoch cycle and an extended 10-epoch cycle.
Methodology
Text Normalization: We converted all text to lowercase to maintain consistency and avoid discrepancies in the model's interpretation.
Tokenization: The text was segmented into tokens, a fundamental step for BERT-based models to understand and process language data.
Padding and Truncation: To fit the model's fixed input size, reviews were padded or truncated to a specified length, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.
Splitting: The dataset was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets, with the split carefully randomized to prevent any bias.
Fine-Tuning Durations: The model was fine-tuned twice; first over a short span of 3 epochs to simulate a quick learning scenario, and subsequently over a longer stretch of 10 epochs to evaluate the benefits of deeper learning.
Accuracy: We calculated the percentage of sentiments correctly classified by the model to gauge its overall effectiveness.
Precision: This metric helped us understand the model's ability to classify positive sentiments accurately, crucial in avoiding false positives.
Recall: We assessed the model's capability to capture all relevant instances of positive sentiments, an essential measure of its sensitivity.
F1 Score: By harmonizing precision and recall, the F1 score served as a single metric reflecting the model's balanced performance.
Results 
It is true that the untrained model's initial results were as expected: underwhelming. This lack of accuracy serves to highlight the chasm that exists between the raw potential of an untrained algorithm and the refined precision of a model that has been fine-tuned. It is true that the absence of training is akin to a musician attempting to play without practice, resulting in a performance that lacks both nuance and understanding of the piece at hand.
The results from the 10-epoch model training presented an intriguing outcome; the model displayed signs of overfitting. This was evident through its decreased precision and recall when applied to the test set, suggesting that the model had become too specialized to the training data, impairing its generalization to new data. The decrease in F1 score further confirmed this trend, indicating a decline in the model's overall predictive balance.
It is true that when we dialed back to a modest 3-epoch training period, the model's performance improved markedly. This model did not just learn; it adapted with an agility that captured the subtleties of sentiment more faithfully than its more extensively trained counterpart. It is true that this demonstrated a key insight: efficiency in training does not necessarily require extensive iterations. Sometimes, less is indeed more.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it is true that the insights gleaned from this venture extend beyond the binary world of sentiment analysis. They touch upon the very essence of learning—artificial or otherwise. Just as a master craftsman knows the number of strikes needed to shape a tool, so too must we understand the optimal strokes required to sculpt an adept neural network. This study, therefore, stands as a guidepost on the path to such mastery.
